# Food Image and News Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to classify food images and news articles into relevant categories. It consists of two main parts: image classification and text classification.

In the image classification section, various deep learning models including InceptionV3, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and Xception were implemented using Keras. Techniques such as data augmentation and handling missing labels were employed to enhance model performance.

For text classification, two datasets (AG News and BBC News) were utilized to tokenize and train the NLP model.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement deep learning models for image classification to classify food images.
- Develop an NLP model for text classification to categorize news articles effectively.
- Explore techniques such as data augmentation and tokenization to improve model performance.
- Present results through visualizations and evaluation metrics to assess model effectiveness.
