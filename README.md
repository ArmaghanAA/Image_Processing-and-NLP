# Food Image and News Classification

This project consists of two separate parts. The first part focuses on image classification and the second part focuses on text classification. 

For the image classification part, several models such as InceptionV3, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and xception were implemented using keras. In order to improve the models' performance, data augmentation and managing missing labels were carried out. 

In the text classification part, two datasets (AG News and BBC News) were used to tokenize and train the NLP model.
